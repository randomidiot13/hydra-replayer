# Hydra Replayer

This site hosts Tetris replays played by Hydra, a program that finds the decision tree that maximizes immediate perfect clear chance. All replays are played under the Jstris ruleset, namely using the Jstris randomizer (based on [alea](https://github.com/macmcmeans/aleaPRNG), which is transcluded here), using the Jstris 180 kick table, and abiding by see 7 (held piece, active piece, and the 5 previews).

To view a replay, navigate to the site, then append `?<number>` to the URL, where `<number>` is the ID for the replay. The complete list of uploaded replays can be viewed in the `replays` folder.
